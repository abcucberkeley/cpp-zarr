# Announcing C-Blosc2 2.8.0
A fast, compressed and persistent binary data store library for C.

## What is new?

New bytedelta filter added.  SIMD support for Intel and ARM platforms is there.
We have blogged about this: https://www.blosc.org/posts/bytedelta-enhance-compression-toolset.rst
Thanks to Aras Pranckeviƒçius for inspiration and initial implementation.

There are also some minor improvements in BloscLZ, leading to better
compression ratios in general.  BLoscLZ version bumped to 2.5.2.
Also, we have updated internal zlib-ng codecs to its latest version (2.0.7).

C-Blosc2 should be backward compatible with C-Blosc, so you can start using
it right away and increasingly start to use its new functionality, like the
new filters, prefilters, super-chunks and frames.
See docs in: https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/c-blosc2.html

## What is it?

Blosc2 is a high performance data container optimized for binary data.
It builds on the shoulders of Blosc, the high performance meta-compressor
(https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc).

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever
container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the super-block name).
It supports storing data on both memory and disk using the same API.
Also, it adds more compressors and filters.
