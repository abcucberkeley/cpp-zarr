## What is it?

Blosc2 is a high performance data container optimized for binary data.
It builds on the shoulders of Blosc, the high performance meta-compressor
(https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc).

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever
container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the super-block name).
It supports storing data on both memory and disk using the same API.
Also, it adds more compressors and filters.
